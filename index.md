The [SciAuth](https://sciauth.org/) fellows program pairs students from U.S. higher education institutions with project mentors to collaborate on student-led projects on the topic of authentication and authorization for scientific collaborations using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io). The program supports 6 student fellows per year (18 total from July 2021 to June 2024), with an emphasis on recruiting participants from under-represented communities.

Each student fellow proposes a research project (either selected from a [list of example projects](https://github.com/SciAuth/fellows/issues) or proposed by the fellow) related to the topic of authentication and authorization for scientific collaborations. See [https://scitokens.org](https://scitokens.org) for background on this topic. Each fellow pursues their research project remotely over a 12 week period with a member of the SciAuth team (Basney, Bockelman, or Weitzel) providing guidance (i.e., via weekly Zoom calls) as a project mentor.

Fellows are selected via a competitive application process according to the strength of the proposed project, the academic preparation of the student, and the diversity of the applicants. Fellows each receive a $1,000 stipend ($333.33 per month for 3 months) to support their research.

Program requirements:
* Applicants must be currently enrolled at an accredited U.S. higher education institution. Both graduate and undergraduate students are eligible.
* Applicants must reside in the United States during the 12 week project period (schedule to be determined by fellow and mentor).
* Travel is not required. All fellows program activities are conducted online.

**The application period is now closed.**

The SciAuth fellows program was inspired by the [IRIS-HEP Fellows Program](https://iris-hep.org/fellows) and the [Trusted CI Fellows Program](https://trustedci.org/fellows).
