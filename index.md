**The SciAuth fellows program is currently accepting applications. See below for details.**

The [SciAuth](https://sciauth.org/) fellows program pairs students from U.S. higher education institutions with project mentors to collaborate on student-led projects on the topic of [cyberinfrastructure](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) security. The program supports 6 student fellows per year (18 total from July 2021 to June 2024), recruited nationally through organizations such as Women in CyberSecurity ([WiCyS](https://www.wicys.org/)), the Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium ([MS-CC](https://www.aamu.edu/about/administrative-offices/information-technology-services/initiatives/minority-serving-cyberinfrastructure-consortium/)), and the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service ([SFS](https://www.sfs.opm.gov/)) program, with an emphasis on recruiting participants from under-represented communities.

Each fellow proposes a research project (either selected from a [list of example projects](https://github.com/SciAuth/fellows/issues) or proposed by the fellow) related to the topic of authorization for scientific collaborations (See [https://scitokens.org](https://scitokens.org) for background on this topic) or related to the broader topic of [cyberinfrastructure](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC) security. Each fellow pursues their research project remotely over a 12 week period with one of the project co-PIs (Basney, Bockelman, or Weitzel) providing guidance (i.e., via weekly Zoom calls) as a project mentor. Fellows are selected via a competitive application process according to the strength of the proposed project, the academic preparation of the student, and the diversity of the applicants. Fellows will also meet regularly as a group to share their research progress and results. Fellows each receive a $1,000 stipend ($333.33 per month for 3 months) to support their research.

Program requirements:
* Applicants must be currently enrolled at an accredited U.S. higher education institution.
* Applicants must reside in the United States during the 12 week project period.
* Travel is not required. All fellows program activities are conducted online.

To apply, send an application by email to [fellows@sciauth.org](mailto:fellows@sciauth.org) containing the following:
* (Required) A short curriculum vitae (CV). Please include current educational status, current residence (U.S. state or territory), and any relevant coursework and/or previous relevant projects and activities.
* (Required) A short proposal. In the proposal you should briefly describe the cyberinfrastructure security research project that you would like to pursue, and how that project relates to your academic/professional interests. The proposal should be short, typically no more than 1-2 pages containing the project description and a short timeline with (preferred) start/end dates and monthly deliverables/milestones for the 3 month (12 week) period, including how you plan to share your project results. For example, you may propose one month to study prior work (e.g., learn about existing software), one month to experiment with a new approach, and one month to document your results.
* (Optional) A short diversity statement. If desired, please provide a short paragraph explaining how your participation would broaden participation from underrepresented groups and/or diverse institutions across geographical regions. See [Broadening Participation at NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp.jsp) for guidance on this topic.

If you have any questions about the application process or would like to discuss possible project ideas, please contact us at [fellows@sciauth.org](mailto:fellows@sciauth.org). If you don't receive a prompt reply, please contact [jbasney@illinois.edu](mailto:jbasney@illinois.edu).

Fellows will be selected on a rolling fashion based on submitted applications. All applications submitted by Monday, October 4, 2021 will receive full consideration.

The SciAuth fellows program was inspired by the [IRIS-HEP Fellows Program](https://iris-hep.org/fellows) and the [Trusted CI Fellows Program](https://trustedci.org/fellows).
