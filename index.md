The [SciAuth](https://sciauth.org/) fellows program pairs students from U.S. higher education institutions with project mentors to collaborate on student-led projects on the topic of cyberinfrastructure security. The program supports 6 student fellows per year (18 total over the 3 year project duration), recruited nationally through organizations such as Women in CyberSecurity ([WiCyS](https://www.wicys.org/)), the Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium ([MS-CC](https://www.aamu.edu/about/administrative-offices/information-technology-services/initiatives/minority-serving-cyberinfrastructure-consortium/)), and the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service ([SFS](https://www.sfs.opm.gov/)) program, with an emphasis on recruiting participants from under-represented communities. The national recruitment efforts allow SciAuth to tap a broader pool of candidates than those at the SciAuth partner institutions and increase the likelihood of SciAuth broadening participation in computing.

Each fellow proposes a research project (either selected from a [list of example projects](https://github.com/SciAuth/fellows/issues) or proposed by the fellow) related to the topic of authorization for scientific collaborations. Each fellow pursues their research project over a 12 week period with one of the project co-PIs (Basney, Bockelman, or Weitzel) assigned as a mentor. Fellows are selected via a competitive application process according to the strength of the proposed project, the academic preparation of the student, and the diversity of the applicants. Fellows will also meet regularly as a group to share their research progress and results. Fellows each receive a $1,000 stipend to support their research.

The call for applications for the 2021 SciAuth fellows program will be posted here soon.

The SciAuth fellows program was inspired by the [IRIS-HEP Fellows Program](https://iris-hep.org/fellows).
