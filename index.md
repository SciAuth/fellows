The [SciAuth](https://sciauth.org/) fellows program pairs students from U.S. higher education institutions with project mentors to collaborate on student-led projects on the topic of cyberinfrastructure security. The program supports 6 student fellows per year (18 total over the 3 year project duration), recruited nationally through organizations such as Women in CyberSecurity ([WiCyS](https://www.wicys.org/)), the Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium ([MS-CC](https://www.aamu.edu/about/administrative-offices/information-technology-services/initiatives/minority-serving-cyberinfrastructure-consortium/)), and the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service ([SFS](https://www.sfs.opm.gov/)) program, with an emphasis on recruiting participants from under-represented communities. The national recruitment efforts allow SciAuth to tap a broader pool of candidates than those at the SciAuth partner institutions and increase the likelihood of SciAuth broadening participation in computing.

Each fellow proposes a research project (either selected from a [list of example projects](https://github.com/SciAuth/fellows/issues) or proposed by the fellow) related to the topic of authorization for scientific collaborations. Each fellow pursues their research project remotely over a 12 week period with one of the project co-PIs (Basney, Bockelman, or Weitzel) providing guidance (i.e., via weekly Zoom calls) as a project mentor. Fellows are selected via a competitive application process according to the strength of the proposed project, the academic preparation of the student, and the diversity of the applicants. Fellows will also meet regularly as a group to share their research progress and results. Fellows each receive a $1,000 stipend ($333.33 per month for 3 months) to support their research.

Program requirements:
* Applicants must be currently enrolled at an accredited U.S. higher education institution.
* Applicants must reside in the United States during the 12 week project period.
* Travel is not required. All fellows program activities are conducted online.

To apply, send an application by email to [fellows@sciauth.org](mailto:fellows@sciauth.org) containing the following:
* (Required) A short curriculum vitae (CV). Please include current educational status, current residence (U.S. state or territory), and any relevant coursework and/or previous relevant projects and activities.
* (Required) A short proposal. In the proposal you should briefly describe the cyberinfrastructure security research project that you would like to pursue, and how that project relates to your academic/professional interests. The proposal should be short, typically no more than 1-2 pages containing the project description and a short timeline with (preferred) start/end dates and monthly deliverables for the 3 month (12 week) period, including how you plan to share your project results. For example, you may propose one month to study prior work, one month to experiment with a new approach, and one month to document your results.
* (Optional) A short diversity statement. If desired, please provide a short paragraph explaining how your participation would broaden participation from underrepresented groups and diverse institutions across geographical regions. See [Broadening Participation at NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp.jsp) for guidance on this topic.

If you have any questions about the application process or would like to discuss possible project ideas, please contact us at [fellows@sciauth.org](mailto:fellows@sciauth.org). If you don't receive a prompt reply, please contact [jbasney@illinois.edu](mailto:jbasney@illinois.edu).

Fellows will be selected on a rolling fashion based on submitted applications. All applications submitted by Monday, October 4, 2021 will receive full consideration.

The SciAuth fellows program was inspired by the [IRIS-HEP Fellows Program](https://iris-hep.org/fellows) and the [Trusted CI Fellows Program](https://trustedci.org/fellows).
